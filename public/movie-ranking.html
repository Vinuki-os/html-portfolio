<h1>The Best CDramas</h1>
<h2>My top 3 C-Dramas of 2024.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>When I fly towards you</h3>
<p>Tbf, I think i watched this last year but this was soooo good. This cdrama is my all time favorite. Like the cinematography is too good.</p>
<h3>Time and him are just right</h3>
<p>This was so cute. I think I'm into these high school dramas</p>
<h3>A river runs through it</h3>
<p>This was very much like wifty, but the ending is so disappointing. Wish they didn't rush the ending and make the mail lead look like the 2nd lead:(.</p>
<h3>My Unicorn Girl</h3>
<p>I know i said top 3 but this was just too good to not enter. But I'm pretty sure that it was good because I watched it when I had exams coming up. It was corny. It was soo good</p>
