<h1>About Me🫧</h1>
<p>Hey there! I'm Vinuki, the brain behind this quirky corner of the internet. 🪻 Currently juggling my undergrad life like a pro while exploring the fascinating world of Data Science and Business Analytics. 🎓 When I'm not buried in textbooks (or memes), you can catch me diving into my hobbies, whether it's baking, crocheting, binging on Netflix, or attempting to cook something edible. 🌟</p>

<p>I'm currently trying my best to enjoy my summer holidays to the fullest. I want this holiday to be a wifty like summer🧚 (idk whether that'll be possible though).</p>

<p>This website is my digital playground where I share what i created. Join me in this wild ride of learning, laughing, and maybe even a bit of procrastinating (we all do it!). Let's make the internet a little more awesome together! 🌈</p>
